# Semantics behind interfaces

* Booleans and integers are deterministic.
* Booleans will never go away
* Therefore, buttons won't.

# Tactility

# Two paradigms

Buttons are for discrete operations: Move one frame to the right, scale by exactly 15 percent, write "Plinth" on the screen.

Humans don't always think in discrete scales, forcing them to think that way is slower.

Hand gestures = continuous scales.
