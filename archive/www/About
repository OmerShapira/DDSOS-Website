About

DDSOS is a project about the war on the internet.

Special software parses recently recorded DOS and DDOS attacks from security organizations, turns them into stories, and reads them out loud into a phone.

The emergency phonebox latches onto buildings and fences, inviting listeners to experience the war on the internet.

DDSOS was created by Omer Shapira, Ryan Bartley and Max Ma.
